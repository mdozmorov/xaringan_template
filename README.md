# Building blocks for Xaringan presentation

[Xaringan](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=xaringan) by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui) is a great package to make good looking and portable presentations. 

[presentation.Rmd](presentation.Rmd) contains YAML settings and basic examples reminding how to insert an image, make two-column slide etc. [Example](https://bios691-cancer-bioinformatics.netlify.app/slides/02_unix/01_unix#1).

Learn more about [xaringan Presentations](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html). This example is not meant to be comprehensive.

[xaringan-my.css](xaringan-my.css) contains `.large[]`, `.small[]`, and `.tiny[]` formatting styles. `xaringan-themer.css` is created by [xaringanthemer](https://github.com/gadenbuie/xaringanthemer) in the corresponding chunk in [presentation.Rmd](presentation.Rmd).

[xaringanExtra](https://github.com/gadenbuie/xaringanExtra) by [Garrick Aden-Buie](https://github.com/gadenbuie) makes the presentations even more flexible.
